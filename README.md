# FixEscape

Since Minecraft 1.19, Mojang has broken the way the game handles keybind, and it doesn't look like they are going to fix it.

Instead of using the emitted key, they use the physical key pressed. People that rebind keys are left alone on this.

For most keybind it's ok, you can remap them in-game. But you can't remap escape.

This mod adds a second escape key that is re-bindable on any key you want. So you can finally play the game again even if you're using `caps:swapescape`.

## Versions

NOTE: Starting 1.21 this mod targets NeoForge. I'm dropping Forge support as most mod seems to do the same.

This branch produce a jar compatible for 1.21 and 1.21.1


## Credits

This mod is inspired by [TheEnderCore's EscapeScreen](https://github.com/theendercore/EscapeScreen) for Fabric, but since these days I'm playing with Forge, I needed a forge version.
